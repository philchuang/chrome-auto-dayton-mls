Auto Dayton MLS
======================

What is it?
-----------
Chrome extension for making the [Dayton, OH MLS](http://dayton.rapmls.com/scripts/mgrqispi.dll?APPNAME=Dayton&PRGNAME=MLSLogin&ARGUMENT=1qpfrF1qRkQqOropCefZ1w%3D%3D&KeyRid=1) site easier to use.

Why would I want to use it?
---------------------------

The Dayton, OH MLS site is difficult to use. You can't bookmark searches, and it has a terrible query page.

So I wrote an extension for Chrome that simplifies the search to the primary fields and also allows you to create a bookmark to re-run that search.

How do I get it?
----------------

1. Save the [Auto Dayton-MLS.crx](https://github.com/philchuang/chrome-auto-dayton-mls/blob/master/crx/Auto%20DAY-MLS.crx) chrome extension file to your computer.
2. Open a new Chrome tab to the extensions management page, `chrome://extensions` - *sorry, chrome blocks this from being a link, so type it in or copy & paste*.
3. Drag & drop the crx file into the extensions management page.
4. Look for it in the browser actions section to the right of the address bar.
