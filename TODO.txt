WHAT WAS JUST ACCOMPLISHED
* scrape listing details
* on extension initialize/1st run, clear all temp data
* pictures!
* (x) on the right of each field to clear it - doesn't update binding :(

WHERE TO START NOW
* listings page 
	* use ngcloak
	* filters/sort
		* save filter/sort between page reloads
		* status dropdown filter
		* updated (hours) filter
		* days listed filter
	* each listing
		* render picture list dynamically only when thumbnail clicked
		* reverse-sorted history
		* collapsible history
		* personal notes
		* delete button
		* save button
		* ranking field

STUFF TO DO LATER
* data export
* PageAction to trigger scrape, open listings
* convert from event page back to background page for live updates to listings
	* OR have an event listener for sync save, replace listings live!
* listing sets
	* favorites (within set)
* listings page
	* do floating left filter bar the right way
	* fix filter field clear controls binding
	* results paging, beginning to be a memory/cpu hog
